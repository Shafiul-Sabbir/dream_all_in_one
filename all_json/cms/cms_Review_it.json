      "text": "Thinking of using Dream Tourism to skip the lines? Here's what you should know first... Dream Tourism offers a service to help you avoid ticket lines, but be aware that their process might not be what you expect. While I confirmed payment and expected downloadable tickets, I received instructions instead. This lack of clarity caused some concern, and I even opened a PayPal case (which I later canceled). Thankfully, Dream Tourism did come through with the actual tickets. However, the experience between purchasing and receiving them was stressful. While their service lets you skip the very long lines (which is a big plus!), Note that you're paying double the price for these tickets. (also note that kids get in free anyway). If you're flexible with timing, you can potentially save money by buying directly from the source, \"Coopculture.it\"",

The Colosseum was amazing and we loved seeing it which is why is a 3*, for the service of this company it would have been a 1*. The representative that called has also been badgering me for a 5* review by calling and messaging and asking to let them know when the 5* review is posted. If you can, book with someone else. I left a 3* review and was called by the company asking why I left a 3* review… this is a week after I used their services. Surely some GDPR laws broken there?? called me a liar over the phone, shouted and swore at me. I actually never been treated this way by a company. Disgusting behaviour!",

We left our hotel at 6am to walk the 22 min to the meeting spot, Boone was there. We waited and no one showed. We called Viator and they called Dream Tourism. Dream tourism said they canceled the tour because it was too cold. It was a bit cool because it was early morning, but by the time we would’ve gotten to Capri it would’ve been in the 80s or upper 70s which would’ve been perfect weather. The tour guide told a fib, because he actually canceled because there were only four of us that had signed up. He canceled because not enough people signed up. Our complaint is that we were not told in time. It was only after we called that he sent an email out to us stating that the tour had been canceled. This is not good customer service, and ruined our beautiful day we had planned !!! I do not recommend doing anything with dream tourism, they cannot be trusted. I understand the need to cancel, if the trip didn’t fill up, but we should’ve been given plenty of notice!!!!!",

      "text": "Very confusing options, thought I had booked for a guided tour, discovered it wasn't even with an audio guide. Complained to the company, agreed to \"upgrade\" us to premium to include an audio guide, for free (well, for a 5* review). \"Tickets\" didn't arrive until a couple of hours before the tour. Timing was confusing - we thought we would be doing the Colosseum first, then the Roman Forum and Palatine Hills, instructions said otherwise, so we had to be there earlier than anticipated, to be at the Colosseum at our booked time. Told us we'd need an hour for the Forum and Palatine, but you really need much longer. The assistants at the gate told us we'd need longer and should do the Colosseum first and do the others when we were ready (we decided to just do a quick tour of the Forum and Palatine rather than to and fro again). Skip the Line at the Colosseum worked well, but there was a wait for the audio guides. However, it's well worth the visit for all the history and magnificence of the building. I would recommend just buy the skip the line tickets with audio guide from the official site and save the extra hassle.",

However the inside the coliseum was awful. Not family friendly , staff were all very rude. Not at all pram or elderly friendly. Absolulty crammed , no room to actually enjoy and see the place, just a complete money racket, which could be run soo much smoother with a bit of organisation, and some training for the staff to actually be kind and helpful rather than rude.",
